## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout and page responsiveness.

Users should be able to:

## My process

1. Change background color of body
2. Add background images
3. Create wrapper divs
4. Add images and text
5. Give images sizes and styles in CSS
6. Give texts and icons font styles in CSS
7. Create hover effects for buttons and icons

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Media Queries

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using Media Queries, the main challenge that I overcame was to create responsive page that would work on any screen and create layout of images and texts specifically like it is shown in design. After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the CSS code using mobile first approach, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making wabsites responsive with desired layout.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic and interactive projects
